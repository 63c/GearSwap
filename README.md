Setting up my Gearswaps and Github updating.

1.) Create a Github account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join

2.) Download Github Desktop if you don't already have it : https://desktop.github.com/

3.) Take your existing Gearswap folder from inside Windower\Addons and move it to your desktop.
    If you're transitioning to my gearswaps from other gearswaps remove the Gearswap\Data folder
    from the old folder, and place it somewhere you can find to help you edit my gearswaps later, if
    you're setting up gearswap for the first time you can delete the old Geasrswap\Data folder
    altogether.
    
4.) Open Github Desktop. (As admin if your Gearswap Folder is located in Program Files)

5.) Click File, Clone Repository, click the URL tab, in the Repository box put: Selindrile/GearSwap
    in the Local Path box put the location your Gearswap directory was, for example
    C:\Program Files\Windower\Addons\Gearswap           then click Clone.
    
6.) Move your old Gearswap folder to the same directory as the new one to merge them,
    make sure not to overwrite any files, choose skip or "do not replace" for any common files.

7.) To update my gearswaps in the future open up Github Desktop and click the third button (Fetch Origin, then
    push the same button again.

8.) Optional: If you're new to editing files like this I highly reccomend Notepad++, https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
    and using File: Open Folder as Workspace, and adding your Gearswap\Data folder there.
  
9.) Optional: Obtain my Cheatsheet and Init file (Goes in Windower\Script folder) from:
    https://www.dropbox.com/sh/20vy32liub3glxz/AAAiIVHAasFdwCK1SZdZz7d_a?dl=0
    
10.) Optional: For full functionality my gearswap and init files do depend on a few other addons that can
    be found in your launcher, I'll list them here: Addons: Shortcuts, Cancel, Itemizer. Plugins: Timers, Run
