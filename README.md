Setting up one-click updates for my gearswap with Github Desktop.

1.) Create a Github account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join
2.) Download Github Desktop if you don't already have it : https://desktop.github.com/
3.) Take your existing Gearswap folder from inside Windower\Addons and move it to your desktop.
4.) Open Github Desktop. (As admin if your Gearswap Folder is located in Program Files)
5.) Click File, Clone Repository, click the URL tab, in the Repository box put: Selindrile/GearSwap
    in the Local Path box put the location your Gearswap directory was, for example
    C:\Program Files\Windower\Addons\Gearswap           then click Clone.
6.) Move your old Gearswap folder to the same directory as the new one to merge them,
    make sure not to overwrite any files, choose skip or "do not replace" for any common files.
7.) Optional: Obtain my Cheatsheet and Init file (Goes in Windower\Script folder) from:
    https://www.dropbox.com/sh/20vy32liub3glxz/AAAiIVHAasFdwCK1SZdZz7d_a?dl=0
8.) Optional: For full functionality my gearswap and init files do depend on a few other addons that can
    be found in your launcher, I'll list them here: Addons: Shortcuts, Cancel, Itemizer. Plugins: Timers, Run
9.) To update my gearswaps in the future open up Github Desktop and click the third button (Fetch Origin, then
    push the same button again.
